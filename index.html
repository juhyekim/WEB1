  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related
   content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least
    one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px">All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
There are also private websites, such as a company's internal site for its
employees. A website can thus be accessed via the Internet or a private intranet.</p>

<p>Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging
from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education.
Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often
starts with a home page.</p>

<p>Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops,
tablets, and smartphones. The software application used on these devices is
 called a web browser.</p>
